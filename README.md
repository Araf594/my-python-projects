# 🐍 Araf's Python Project Portfolio

Welcome! I'm **Araf**, a passionate Python programmer and tech student from Bangladesh. This repository showcases my hands-on Python projects built with clean, beginner-to-intermediate level code.

All projects are CLI-based (command-line interface) and focus on **automation, problem-solving, and simple game mechanics**.
